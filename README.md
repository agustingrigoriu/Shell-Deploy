# README

The idea of this project is to create a very easy-to-use script that allows us to quickly deploy our projects on any server.

## Instructions of use

To start using this, execute the *deploy.sh* that is inside the *deploy* folder. It receives three parameters, and one of them is optional:

``` 
./deploy.sh SSH_CONNECTION SERVER_DIRECTORY_PATH [PORT]
```

Example:
```
./deploy.sh 200.x.x.x /home/usuername/project/ 2000

```
